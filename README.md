Jenkins modernized theme
========================

![Preview](/preview.png?raw=true "Preview image")

During starring at a antique looking boring jenkins ui I started to make some improvements 
everytime I am bored or needed to wait for builds.
I think it now looks much nicer although not everything is correctly fixed yet.
The resulting css may not be perfect and break with further releases of jenkins.
This one is made for Jenkins ver. 1.569 and Chrome and works nice so far.
Should work with other modern browsers but I don't guarantee.
So use it at your own risk, fix it when you update or disable it to return to the old ui.

The abandonment of an additional js for the theme is intended.

You have can use it by installing the simple theme plugin:

or when you are not the admin of the ci server, by installing the chrome extension stylish and add the skin for your jenkins domain:

Feel free to change it the way you want it.
Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
